										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>SAN DIEGO, CA</strong> – <a href="https://www.eldoradostone.com/">Eldorado Stone</a> infuses traditional textures with modern sophistication by introducing its newest color palette: Osso <a href="https://www.eldoradostone.com/products/romabrick/">RomaBrick</a>. The warm blonde undertones of ivory-inspired Osso provide a fresh, contemporary option for the classically minded shape of RomaBrick, bridging the gap between ancient sensibilities and present day design trends.</p>
<p>“The warm neutral hue of Osso RomaBrick provides unique options for exploring subtleties of tones and composition,” said Sarah Lograsso, Director of Marketing. “This compelling color palette puts a modern spin on the timeless texture of weathered brick, providing an expressive union of traditional and contemporary styles.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="TWEET%20THIS:%20#Osso RomaBrick from @eldoradostone provides an expressive union of traditional and contemporary #design styles. http://bit.ly/OssoRomaBrick #stoneveneer ">TWEET THIS: #Osso RomaBrick from @eldoradostone provides an expressive union of traditional and contemporary #design styles. http://bit.ly/OssoRomaBrick #stoneveneer </a></strong></p>
<p>Osso’s distinctively fair color palette evokes an authentic European aesthetic with a modern touch for more design versatility. Whether applied on an accent wall or as the focal point, RomaBrick offers an artistically timeworn appearance that lends texture and nuance to any space. In addition to Osso, RomaBrick is available nationwide in three classic color palettes: Brolio, Castello and Bracciano<sup>®</sup>.</p>
<p>Evocative of ancient Rome, RomaBrick is a wider-proportioned profile with an irregular shape that projects enormous visual interest. With a slightly thicker form, RomaBrick blends well with other Eldorado Stone profiles and varies in length from 9 inches to 10.25 inches and 1.5 inches to 2 inches in height.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>SAN DIEGO, CA</strong> – <a href="https://www.eldoradostone.com/">Eldorado Stone</a> brightens the clean lines of contemporary architectural stone with the debut of Whitecap LedgeCut33<sup>®</sup>. Providing a multilayered color option, Whitecap presents an artistic display of highlights and depth patterns inspired by the sight of waves crashing upon unmarred coastal shores. In combination with its lighter, gray tones, the varying hues of Whitecap LedgeCut33 include accents of warm coppers and muted blues in a complex mix reminiscent of pristine sand stirred by the rolling surf.</p>
<p>“The use of color within a space can bring back old memories or create entirely new ones in an instant, regardless of whether you’re working with a modern design aesthetic or something more traditional,” said Sarah Lograsso, Director of Marketing. “With the coastal-inspired interplay of tones in Whitecap, our aim is to captivate and inspire the architecture and design community to rethink the way they incorporate rich, darker details while continuing to embrace the appeal of a brighter neutral base.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://ctt.ec/e1fwe">TWEET THIS: Newly introduced Whitecap #LedgeCut33 from @eldoradostone adds coastal-inspired hues to the contemporary, linear profile. http://bit.ly/WhitecapLedgeCut33 #stoneveneer</a></strong></p>
<p>With the introduction of Whitecap, Eldorado Stone reveals the next generation of modern coloring techniques and continues to elevate the tones and textures found in the natural world. Whether applied on an accent wall or as the focal point of any space, Whitecap infuses subtle warmth while providing a balance of strength and beauty that characterizes some of the nation’s most treasured seaside escapes.</p>
<p>As the latest addition to Eldorado Stone’s <a href="https://www.eldoradostone.com/collections/modern/">Modern Collection</a>, Whitecap LedgeCut33 guarantees a natural and authentic appearance. Designed for dry-stack installation, this profile is easy to handle, cut and install. The number 33 represents the 3-inch height and three different lengths of 12 inches, 18 inches and 24 inches of each individual stone shape. In addition to Whitecap, LedgeCut33 is available nationwide in five inspiring color palettes: Beach Pebble, Birch, Golden Oak, Ocean Floor and Sage.</p>

<p>In 2017, Eldorado Stone relocated to consolidate activities from two preexisting locations—an aging manufacturing facility near Greencastle and a distribution facility in Hagerstown, Maryland—to a state-of-the-art, 432,000-square-foot building in the Antrim Commons Business Park in Franklin County, Pennsylvania. The plant employs more than 250 people with potential to hire additional staff. The facility incorporates a system designed to improve productivity and reduce waste materials by repurposing wastewater.</p>
<p>The Franklin County Area Development Corporation strives to promote issues that affect the community and help maintain the high standards and working conditions within the county.  Every year it hosts a highly-anticipated dinner honoring employers of all sizes that help the county flourish and prosper. More than 400 people attended the dinner this year.</p>
