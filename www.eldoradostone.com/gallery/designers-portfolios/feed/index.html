										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Below is an interview with Tim Holley, Marketing Manager of builder Cascade West.</em></p>
<p><strong>What was the overall design goal/objective for this project and/or its clients?</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to showcase an absolutely unbelievable location and create a home designed to complement and enhance the homeowner&#8217;s fun-loving lifestyle of play and socializing. The Aurora (or sleeping beauty) was built for an active and engaging family with great taste, a love of the outdoors, and some very creative ideas!</p>
<p>This incredible home features : 6BR (5 Suites) : 4 Full Bathrooms 2 Powders : Blended Indoor/Outdoor Living : Sauna : Mud &amp; Craft Room : Exercise Room : Arcade Room : Batting Cage : 5 Car Garage : Pool : Basketball Half-Court (and a lot more including breath-taking views of the Columbia River and Downtown Portland!) <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Are there any interesting or unique details about this project? </strong></p>
<p>This home was designed for family which means it has lots of amenities for kids not seen in other homes in our marketplace. This house is packed with so many fun activities the kids will never want to leave!</p>
<p>The massive 5 Car Garage includes even more engaging options like the indoor half-court regulation size basketball court as well as a regulation indoor, retractable batting cage! There&#8217;s even a multi-sport net for indoor tennis, badminton, and volleyball.</p>
<p>This home has a daylight basement like no other, an entire floor dedicated to fun &#8211; including a sauna, huge entertainment room with panoramic doors, exercise room, guest suites and it&#8217;s very own arcade room complete with pinball machines and vintage arcade cabinets that each hold over 4,000 games!</p>
<p><strong>Inspiration for using Eldorado Stone?  Why Eldorado Stone was selected? </strong></p>
<p>We’ve been using Eldorado Stone for years, our last highlighted project was The Ascension from 2016, another award-winning home that ended up being featured in the promotional video ‘Invite The Beauty of Nature In’.</p>
<p>The First thing we can speak to is the quality of these products and the ease of installation. We put homes up quickly and often times have to work when the weather is on our side, sometimes that means impeccable timing, something these products lend themselves to. If there were ever an issue with flawed materials or cumbersome processes &#8211; we would be looking for a new solution. Eldorado Stone is the solution.</p>
<p>Secondly, the look and feel. The color palettes and texture profiles are offered in a wide variety &#8211; all of which are appealing. Honestly, the toughest part about using Eldorado Stone to build with is choosing your favorite iteration. For us, this was a perfect fit. Their diverse and handsome product lines couple very nicely with all of the different styles we build in. We’re able to give our customer what they want without compromise.</p>
<p>Lastly, the price. Surprisingly affordable and durable. We consider this to be one of the more economic investments in aesthetic. Rarely do you find a product that looks as good &#8211; for as long &#8211; for as little. We have the utmost confidence in these products. Building in Washington + Oregon means we’ve subjected Eldorado Stone to extremes. Driving hail, freezing rain, heavy snow, strong winds, and yes… even the occasional summer heat-wave. After all that you think we would’ve found something wrong by now. Nope.</p>
<p><strong>How was Eldorado Stone incorporated into the design?</strong></p>
<p>We utilized Eldorado Stone Ledgecut33 in White Cap on the exterior of this home, the profile chosen was exactly what our homeowners wanted because it’s semi-modern and uniform look along with the varied color &amp; texture provided all the visual interest upon close inspection while the White Cap colorway accompanied our white farmhouse exterior perfectly. The product didn’t draw any attention from the overall aesthetic and was rewarding to look at once the viewer’s eyes came across it. Suffice to say it bolstered the original concept for the exterior and enhanced it without overpowering the other design elements.</p>
<p>We also used TundraBrick in Chalk Dust with dark grey grout to create more visual interest in the living spaces of the home &#8211; where it did become a focal point in the foyer, bbq and wine display/wet bar areas. There it served as the perfect backdrop to draw attention to the spaces and tie-in the exterior/outdoor elements — which was a goal for our homeowners from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>What steps were taken to achieve the design aim of the project? </strong></p>
<p>We met our clients on-site to lay the house out according to our uniquely created plans and literally walk the client through their home-to-be even before the concrete is poured. And although we’re standing in a field (bring your boots readers) we can bring the vision full circle. This allowed us to create the perfect positioning of the home and articulate it’s placement to capture all of the best the plot has to offer; the setting sun, the densely forested feel, natural light, panoramic views, and the ability to add a terraced walking trail that winds down toward a seating area and fireplace. Our face-to-face design sessions were crucial to the design/build process as well. If our homeowners were unsure about a certain space, measurement, or layout we personally walked them through a similar home to point out the resemblances and differences they could find there and what to expect if they decided to make some changes. Working together and becoming totally immersed in the way your home looks, feels, and functions is what we’re passionate about.</p>
<p>Cascade West is so entirely unique to our marketplace because we’re the only true custom home builder in all of Clark County. For us, the sky&#8217;s the limit and as long as there’s a will there’s a way. The old saying ‘move heaven and earth to make it happen’ well Cascade West moves heaven, earth, foundations, walls, and anything else to create exactly what our customers want.</p>
<p><strong>How does the client feel about the final results? </strong></p>
<p>Our homeowners are absolutely thrilled with the final result. As a family with young children, who happen to love all things Disney, they were even excited about the name we chose &#8211; Aurora because it’s one of their favorite princess’ from the tale of Sleeping Beauty. Locally, this home has also become a record-breaking award winner resulting in the first and only ‘Best of Everything’ award from the Clark County Parade of Homes. The award combines every category that was voted on by industry professionals which include: Best Floor Plan, Best Architecture, Best Kitchen, Best Master Suite, Best Outdoor Living Area, Best Entertainment Room, Best Interior Decor, Best Landscaping and the coveted Best of Show). Additional categories awarded to The Aurora were from the viewing public &#8211; known as the People’s Choice awards and they included Best Entertainment Room, Best Outdoor Living Area, Best Landscaping and another Best of Show!</p>
<p><strong>Closing remarks?</strong></p>
<p>Inspired by the majesty of the Northern Lights and this family’s everlasting love for Disney, this home plays host to enlighteningly open vistas and playful activity. Like its namesake, the beloved Sleeping Beauty, this home embodies family, fantasy, and adventure in their truest form. Visions are seldom what they seem, but this home did begin Once Upon a Dream.</p>
<p>At Cascade West, we strive to surpass the needs, wants, and expectations of every client and create a home that unifies and compliments their lifestyle. This is what home feels like. This is where family happens. This is Cascade West. Our dream is building yours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Orlando, Florida the unveiling of the Meritage Builder reNEWable Living Home was introduced to the public and turned out to be a huge win for eco-friendly construction. Meritage is known for escalating the idea of sustainably efficient and high performing homes for the betterment of the future. The 2018 reNEWable Living Home in particular, meets stringent federal government guidelines for a renewable home with zero energy rated performance that ensures that future owners breathe and live better.</p>
<p>Eldorado Stone was utilized both on the exterior and in various interior spaces in the home, offering a sleek and modern feel that matches the home’s cutting edge, eco-friendly style.</p>
<p>The exterior of the home flaunts LedgeCut33 in Beach Pebble, a contemporary stone with contrasting colors and unorthodox patterns that suggest the property is anything but ordinary. Once you enter, you are greeted with an open floor plan that leads your eyes right to the floor to ceiling windows that showcase the gorgeous outside deck. It’s hard to miss the outdoor fireplace as it takes center stage in the outdoor living area. Eldorado Stone’s Marquee24 in Dove Tail encompasses the fireplace in subtle hues of natural cut limestone that perfectly define a modern masterpiece without taking attention away from the beautiful pool in the background.</p>
<p>Back inside and up the stairs is the home office that looks over the stairwell. The design of the office takes a turn from the rest of the property as it brings a more traditional feel to the home. The wall looking over the office space is covered in the dark and moody TundraBrick in Ironside. Classically shaped with slightly squared edges, TundraBrick is worn to look as if it’s been battling the elements for ages.</p>
<p>The final stone feature in the home can be found in the powder room downstairs where Eldorado’s Vintage Ranch in Saddlewood adds a rustic modernity in the form of a wood-inspired accent wall. This American classic is composed of hand-selected boards that give a masculine touch to the space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The creative uses and applications of Eldorado Stone continue to be as diverse and as interesting as the people who specify it. In recent years, we’ve seen a variety of beautiful applications that both impress and inspire. As the acceptance of manufactured stone widens and its many benefits become more known, we find Eldorado Stone to be the ideal choice for projects in both residential and commercial exterior and interior settings&#8211;anywhere the timeless look and feel of stone is desired.<br />
A highly unique example of this is seen in the newly constructed Wall of Honour at The Royal Military College (RMC) of Canada. Established in 1876, this prestigious college in Kingston, Ontario is the equivalent to the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force Academies all rolled into one.<br />
The idea of the Wall of Honour stemmed from the members of the class of 1963’s desire to provide a timeless and highly unique gift to the school. It was to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their entry to the College as freshmen in 1959. The alumni committee wanted to create a place on campus where ex-cadets of the three Canadian Services Colleges of the past including RMC, could be honored for outstanding achievements and contributions to Canada or the world. Each year, a nominating committee reviews submissions for any and all eligible honorees and submits recommendations to a Selection Committee. Honorees have their names and details of their contributions immortalized on cast bronze plaques on the Wall. This first year, five outstanding ex-cadets were named from throughout the school’s history.<br />
The Wall is centrally located on a cobblestone path that Cadets walk past everyday. The Wall stands 6 feet 10 inches high and runs 132 feet in length. Its serpentine design is double-sided and covered with Eldorado’s York Limestone, a profile that blends beautifully with the natural limestone buildings found on the century old campus. The Eldorado cap, with its width and height, gives the Wall that proportional balance and appearance of strength and endurance.<br />
Ted Davie, a member of the class project, was a former military staff officer at the College and has been a successful custom home builder in Ontario, Canada. “We believe this wall has become an important part of the physical landscape of RMC in perpetuity,” says Davie. “It is intended that those recognized on the Wall of Honour will inspire everyone who views it as well as remind all Canadians to be the best that they can be through dedication, hard work, application of their talents and training, and letting Truth, Duty and Valour guide their lives.”<br />
Davie explained that there were several reasons why Eldorado Stone was selected for the Wall. “The Wall’s design required cap pieces at least 24 inches wide with proportional height. After an extensive search, we found that Eldorado Stone offered exactly what we needed,” he says. “I had never worked with Eldorado before but as it turns out, it was the best choice we could have made for the project. We also relied heavily on the expert recommendation of our Master Mason, Walter Krysa.”</p>
<p>Krysa says, “I recommended Eldorado stone because I have worked with it previously, and prefer the look of it over other products. Also, the value, dollar wise, to the customer is a better deal. During the installation process, I was impressed with the variety of sizes, shades, and small, intentional imperfections that were worked into the stone to give it an authentic look. I also noticed a few stones that were made to look as if there were fossils imbedded in it.”</p>
<p>According to Krysa, the Wall of Honour was a bit more of a challenge compared to some jobs because of its serpentine shape and the amount of stone involved. The project required more than 1500 sf of stone, plus corners and caps. “It was a lot like working with a giant jig saw puzzle trying to achieve the desired affect I was going for,” Krysa admits.</p>
<p>The Wall was dedicated during an official ceremony on October 3, 2009 on the campus. The committee had spent more than four years fundraising and planning for the project, which took less than two months to build once they got started.</p>
<p>“Our class was blown away by how well it turned out,” says Davie. “It exceeded our expectations and we are still receiving accolades. In fact, people have been so impressed, that we continue to receive donations to the program and the school because of it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With breathtaking views of the Bay de Porto Marquez in Acapulco, Mexico, you will find Bahlay, a stunning new residential condominium community built on beautiful beachfront property in Pichilingue.</p>
<p>The complex features 26 luxury units and four penthouses in a tropical setting where the jungle meets the sea. Four, nine-story towers sparkle in the sun from the combined use of glass and stone &#8211; Eldorado Stone. In a highly sophisticated design plan, Eldorado’s Alderwood Stacked Stone profile was selected to create a uniquel textural contrast from the generous amount of glass used. It was extremely important to ensure every unit had unobstructed views, so the stone brings balance to all the glass on the towers. The stone was also used to create dramatic accent walls in various spaces throughout the complex, creating a natural backdrop to the sleek architectural lines of the project.</p>
<p>“We selected Eldorado Stone because of its exactness and similarity to natural stone,” says Manual Lara Lopez, of Edmonds International, the project architect for Bahlay. “Ease of installation was important to use because of the way the stone on the towers intersected with the walls that featured unique drop-offs,” he says. Stone is also used around the recreation areas. “Using Eldorado Stone helped to avoid any installation complications.”</p>
<p>The project began in June 2004 and Bahlay opened its doors in November 2006. Each unit features private terraces, Jacuzzi baths, travertine marble floors, granite countertops, and every luxury one desires in a tropical getaway home. The complex also features a restaurant with outdoor seating, a clubhouse, a gorgeous spa and pool area, tennis courts surrounded by beautiful gardens and a roof-top lobby where one can sit and enjoy the spectacular views.</p>
<p>“The use of Eldorado Stone in unique geographical settings like Acapulco is another example of the diversity and growing popularity of manufactured stone internationally,” says Steve Vico, Eldorado’s International Sales Manager. “We have the ability to create a more affordable and convenient design outcome for builders and architects virtually anywhere in the world because of our company’s focus on product innovation and our commitment to meeting customer’s needs.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Panoramic views and state-of-the-art technology are what visitors will find at the new Temecula Library built on a hilltop overlooking this growing suburban community in Southern California.</p>
<p>Approximately 32,000-square-feet, this award-winning library is a tribute to the natural history of the valley and incorporates a variety of elements that create an unforgettable experience to all those who visit. The design team of LPA, Inc. an architectural firm in Irvine, California, was initially commissioned by the City of Temecula in 1998 to identify the best site for the project. Extensive research and thoughtful detail went into every aspect of its location and design, and finally, in mid-December, 2006, the library opened its doors to the public.</p>
<p>The Temecula Valley, or “Valley of the Filtered Light” as the Indians called it, is known for its granite quarries, hot-air balloon and wine festivals, and the highly influential heritage of the Pechanga Indian tribe.</p>
<p>“To honor the unique history of this area, we created a history walkway that leads you to the library from the parking lot and provides information reflecting the days of the early Indians that inhabited the region all the way to the recent incorporation of the city, says Jim Wirick, principal at LPA, Inc. “When one reaches the doors of the library is where you leave the known history behind and you cross the threshold from the past to a place where you can create your own future.”</p>
<p>“We’re extremely proud of this building,” says Bill McAteer, Construction Manager for the City. “The library has become a beacon of learning in our community and is the most technologically advanced library in the entire state of California. It offers Wifi throughout and 43 public access computers,” he explains.</p>
<p>The design of the library is based on a cathedral spine that divides the library into three main sections – to the left of the spine are administrative areas, meeting rooms and reading positions. To the right is a children’s library. A large community room with a massive, 40-foot fireplace is found in the heart of the library that creates a focal point and natural gathering place for visitors. An inspiration garden with a water feature opens up off the children’s area creating another appealing space for visitors of all ages to enjoy.</p>
<p>The north side of the building is all glass with views that reach 20 miles. To complement and balance the use of glass, more than 10,000 square-feet of Eldorado Stone’s Manzanita Cliffstone profile was used throughout the library. Eldorado Stone is found on the fireplace, on accent walls inside the library as well as on the front entry and on battered exterior walls that dramatically angle back.</p>
<p>“We originally considered natural stone, but we liked the look we achieved with Eldorado and it saved us a lot of money,” says McAteer. “It blended beautifully with the hillside and gave us exactly the look we wanted,”</p>
<p>“Our goal in using Eldorado was to find a stone that could replicate the type of stone found naturally in the area, but in an economical fashion that could be used today,” says Wirick. “The budget laughed at using real stone.”</p>
<p>Wirick’s experience with manufactured stone goes back more than 10 years ago when he used Eldorado Stone on the Mission Viejo Library his firm designed. A manufactured stone is often the ideal choice for projects with limited budgets because it is typically half the cost of natural stone, lighter weight and more readily available. Eldorado Stone has manufacturing plants across the country and a network of certified distributors that builders and architects can work with directly to best meet their needs.</p>
<p>“We’re honored that our stone was selected for this prestigious project,” says Brent Spann, Vice President of Marketing for Eldorado Stone. “The textural look and feel of stone adds a timeless sense of beauty to any space and it’s gratifying to know that so many people will enjoy this library and all the attention to detail that went into creating such a welcoming place to learn.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a couple who has a passion for golf, building a dream home right off the signature hole of one of the most beautiful golf courses in the world is just about as good as it gets. Adding the architectural genius of Frank Stolz, AIA, principal of South Coast Architects who helped them realize their dream is like adding icing to the cake!</p>
<p>“This design originated with the client’s desire to duplicate the warmth of Tuscan Architecture,” says Stolz. “The vision that South Coast Architects set forth was to create the feel of an old Tuscan Village as a private residence at the golf community, ‘The Hideaway’ in La Quinta, California. However, we had to keep in mind that we were still designing for a desert lifestyle, which meant an emphasis on indoor/outdoor living and capturing the spectacular views of the golf course and neighboring mountains,” Stolz adds.</p>
<p>Stolz designed the Villa so it offered several areas for privacy and yet created such an open floor plan that it is ideal for entertaining. The entire home is 5,475 sf. From the street, there is a wooden gate at the wall entry that is shaded by old olive trees, as if you’re entering an orchard on your way to an Italian farmhouse. Once inside the courtyard, Stolz created a realistic village environment with carriage garages, an authentic looking watering trough and a distinctive walking path that leads to the entry terrace and to a large stone tower, which is the main entry. Two exterior stairways lead to various destinations that add to the village feel. One set meanders up behind the outdoor fireplace and wraps around to a private casita above the garages. Another leads to a private office for the owner. A second casita is found on the ground level with its own exterior entrance off the terrace, which lends even more to the feel of a small Italian village nestled around a courtyard.</p>
<p>Andrew Pierce Corporation was the builder for this project and according to David Muth, project manager, he knew that the owners were putting their heart and soul into every detail of the home’s design. “The owners had spent a lot of time in Europe and knew exactly what they wanted when it came to the overall look of the home, especially the stone,” says Muth. “The mason ended up creating a dozen mock-ups of various stone profiles and blends to help the family decide what really worked for them. Ultimately, they selected Eldorado Stone’s Orchard Cypress Ridge profile that offers a beautiful blend of stone sizes and colors.”</p>
<p>“The generous use of Eldorado Stone with brick detailing over the majority of the exterior of the home added the authenticity and timelessness that we were striving for in the design,” says Stolz.</p>
<p>“Our clients want the very best, but if we can duplicate something and save money, what client would say no? That’s why we use Eldorado Stone whenever we can. It gives us the opportunity to save money and gives clients exactly the look they desire so we can use more of their budget in other areas.”</p>
<p>Stolz explained that Eldorado Stone was also brought into the interior to continue that feel of authenticity and historical accuracy. Stone is used floor to ceiling in the kitchen for a pizza oven, as well as on the fireplace in the Great Room and on an entire wall in the master bedroom. “Using a material like Eldorado Stone allows for the seamless continuation of space, which works very well for us as we design,” says Stolz.</p>
<p>Pocket doors slide away to open up the kitchen and great room to the home’s lush pool area off the back. Beyond that, a babbling brook, the verdant and colorful landscape of the golf course and the majestic mountain range beyond offer breathtaking views for all. A sky deck above the dining room with wrought iron details, bougainvillea and a large canopy for shade offers even more spectacular views of the golf course for the owners to enjoy, day or night.</p>
<p>The expansive and beautifully designed Master Suite on the far left of the home is truly a retreat in itself with its own private garden that can only be accessed through French Doors off the bathroom. The space includes a Jacuzzi spa and water feature. Stolz also brought stone into the bedroom on one entire wall to frame the bed as a backdrop, which adds to the warm and romantic look the couple desire.</p>
<p>“Stone is what made the house so authentic-looking” says Muth. “It’s such an integral part of the house that it either was going to be a make or break scenario if we made the wrong choice. Luckily, Eldorado Stone really made it!”</p>
<p>The home took more than nine months to design and approximately 16 months to build. But because of the amount of passion, attention to detail and the commitment to authenticity, comfort and beauty everyone invested, it’s no wonder this project has truly become a dream come true!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Located on grassland 20 miles outside of Sacramento in Rocklin, California, you will find William Jessup University, a small liberal arts Christian college. Relocated from San Jose, William Jessup took over the abandoned Herman Miller Western Headquarter building, originally designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry. Since taking over the site and converting the large warehouse into an educational space, several projects have been added and completed in recent years. With limited food production, storage, and the ever growing student population, the need for a dining facility became necessary for campus growth, thus, the Crossroads Café was commissioned.</p>
<p>Dividing the large warehouse into four sections, Crossroads Café occupies just one section at 20,000 square feet. Webb Design as the interior and food service designers collaborated in early phases of the project with owner and architect. Together, we shaped the vision of the space into what it is now &#8211; the core and social community of campus. A prime case study for the evolution of campus dining, Crossroads Café includes exhibition-style platforms that bring theatre into the student dining experience, while the industrial warmth design concept nods to the first life of the building, and, incorporates the warmth of nature that surrounds the campus.</p>
<p>A clear departure from the traditional campus dining facility, Crossroads Café seamlessly incorporates a variety of seating types, and, in conjunction with interior elements and finishes, creates micro dining environments featuring general and specialized dining. Private dining rooms, reserved by staff and students, feature Eldorado Stone’s Nantucket Stacked Stone along the back walls. The stone, juxtaposed with large stainless steel community tables, add warmth and texture creating an overall sense of balance in these active conferencing spaces. Eldorado Stone is also seen in the Quarry Lounge, a micro environment dedicated to lounge style dining, complete with lounge chairs at dining tables and banquette seating. In this space, the stone contributes to and promotes the relaxed dining atmosphere, and becomes a feature framing AV screens and emphasizing banquettes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The goal of this master suite remodel was to provide a beautiful, functional, thoroughly comfortable space. The clients expressed a desire for a luxurious yet simple environment—one that would not feel over-decorated. By using quality materials that speak for themselves, designer <a href="http://www.loriwilesdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lori Wiles</a> was able to create a zen-like space that exceeded their expectations.</p>
<p>The remodel was a transformation of the unused storage area in the bottom level of the clients’ home. Wiles&#8217; creative problem solving didn’t just hide basement remodel problems that included low ductwork and inconveniently located pipes. Instead, these quirks inspired some of the most interesting parts of the remodel, such as the angular wood-paneled headboard wall with built-in nightstands.</p>
<p>With a stone, fire, water, and wood theme, the materials used in this master suite relate strongly to nature. Water flows to the tub from the impactful stone wall in the bathroom, and an opposing stone wall in the bedroom creates a dramatic backdrop for a seating area. Both walls contain candle-filled niches. (Future plans include a fireplace installation on the bedroom wall.) Cherry wood is employed throughout, creating warmth and continuity.</p>
<p>Different types of stone are incorporated to further achieve the natural look and feeling of the bathroom. Accent pebble flooring in the shower and around the freestanding tub complements the large rectangular tile flooring, which has a smoother texture and more continuous movement. Eldorado Stone was chosen for the different textures and dimensions of the black, rugged, stacked stone (which is almost cliff-like as it reaches up the two opposing walls) give the room a very organic feel and create a wonderful relief from the flat surfaces.</p>
<p>Straw shades and linen panels on the windows and rice paper in the glass of the four eight-foot tall sliding doors with disappearing tracks add to the textural interest in the suite.</p>
<p>This luxurious yet organic suite is also extremely functional. The large bathroom includes two separate vanities, abundant storage, and even a coffee station. It has a large, freestanding tub and a walk-in shower. Attached to the bathroom is a huge closet with convenient shelving solutions; a full-length mirror opens up into a jewelry storage niche, a charging station is nestles in with accessories, and a large ottoman provides ample room for packing suitcases.</p>
<p>This stellar transformation succeeds in large part because of its commitment to its natural theme, which drives the choice of materials as well as the marriage of beauty and function.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amidst the traditional &amp; Mediterranean houses in the sought after Piney Point Estates, lays a newly constructed, contemporary, residential work of art. <a href="http://www.contourinteriordesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contour Interior Design</a> is thrilled to showcase a unique design/build residence on a ½ acre lot. This house is a sleekly designed, premier, custom contemporary home with extraordinary detail. This modern-day 6,200 square foot masterpiece resides in a very central location off of Westheimer Road in Houston, TX.</p>
<p>The amazing features of this residence include 4 bedrooms, 4 ½ baths, three fireplaces, one of which is dual sided and finished with Eldorado Stone’s Black River Stacked Stone, bringing the outside stone finish to the interiors creating a continuous indoor/outdoor flow. A sunken living room with Carrera marble floors and 20&#8242; ceiling height pave the way to a huge formal dining room with wood floors and a suspended ceiling. At the heart of the home lies a gourmet island kitchen with an oversized walk- in pantry, custom Italian cabinetry and top of the line Thermador appliances.</p>
<p>An incredible and private master suite features a fireplace, a rain showerhead in the master bath plus multiple body sprays and an oversized Jacuzzi tub. All bedrooms include en suite bathrooms as well. As you explore the space of this home you will find a game room, a leveled media room, a large study with built-ins, a family room with a 4.6’ linear fireplace, a guest suite with a rooftop deck, a wet bar overlooking the backyard, a custom pivot front door, and a huge wall of windows with energy star ratings. In addition to the numerous amenities this home has to offer, we take pride to show off the savant, state of the art, smart system in which one can control all lights, air conditioning, alarm and fireplace from a touch of a button on your ipad or iphone.</p>
<p>Contour Interior Design has worked diligently to design and construct a type of residence that Houston is seeing for the very 1st time. Nina Magon, the president and principal designer of both companies’ states, “uniquely, this house has a modernized contemporary feel with the most up to date technology, but is also on a ½ acre lot designed not only for a sophisticated couple, but more importantly, for a family to enjoy the outdoors and also enjoy the modern city life. Not only has the design of this house been fully thought out, but the quality of construction has been meticulously carried out close to perfection”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The clients of this home wanted to capture their love of wine, entertaining, and great design. Designer Misha of <a href="http://www.designbymisha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Design by Misha</a>, expertly crafted a space for these homeowners that satisfied just that while creating an ultimate WOW-factor at every turn and detail!</p>
<p>The design includes a floating glass catwalk leading to built-in customized wine racks including built-in drawer banks covered in wine boxes. Eldorado Stone’s Sanibel CoastalReef was chosen to add a rustic, yet refined element to the space complimenting the raw steel beams and glass catwalk structure. “This project was meant to stand out, be striking, but in a way remain calm. The natural look of the CoastalReef conjured thoughts of an old wine cave in Tuscany but with a modern twist,” says Misha. Floor to ceiling use of Eldorado Stone provides interest to the focal wall of the fireplace, glass catwalk, and wine storage.</p>
<p>A custom chandelier playfully hangs over an intimate dining area greeted by fresh outdoor breezes and extends into a stunning kitchen featuring recycled concrete counter tops, custom hood and cabinets…this space is truly designed to impress!</p>
