										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Estimating Stone &#038; Brick Quantities Needed</strong></p>
<p>Two components, flats and corners, are used for most installations. Flats are applied to the flat wall surface and are ordered in square feet. Corners are applied to outside corners and are ordered in linear feet. Wrapping the corner of walls, as well as Using corners around window and door openings, provides added dimension and depth and enhances the finished design.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Determine the total project square footage.</strong><br />
Multiply the length (in feet) times the height (in feet) of each surface area to be covered.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Subtract windows, doors or other openings.</strong><br />
Calculate the square footage occupied by windows, doors and other openings. Subtract this amount from the project square footage.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Determine the linear footage of corner pieces needed.</strong><br />
Measure the linear feet of outside corner areas to be covered including any doorways and windows that will have corners.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Determine the square footage of flat pieces required.</strong><br />
Divide the linear footage of corner pieces needed by 2 (One linear foot of corner veneer equals approximately 0.5 square foot of flat veneer) and subtract this corner square footage from the total project square footage. This will give you the square footage of flat veneer required.</p>
<p><em>Note: We recommend adding 10%-15% to your final quantities of flats and corners for best fitting, including cutting and trimming.</em></p>
