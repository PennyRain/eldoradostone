Both colors are available in the acclaimed European Ledge profile, a fusion between old-world stonework and modern design.<br \/>\n\u2022 Barley: Warm natural tones with white-highlights signify new vibrancy for the popular Cliffstone profile, perfect for transitional and contemporary designs.<\/p>\n<p>For more than five decades, PCBC has featured the leading manufacturers in the residential building, home technology and green products categories. This year, more than 300 manufacturers and suppliers will exhibit at the two-day conference.<\/p>\n<p>PCBC will be held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.
