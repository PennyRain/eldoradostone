The new LedgeCut33 is a highly textural yet contemporary, linear-style profile. The stone installs with a clean, dry-stack application that creates instant visual appeal and offers another design solution for Eldorado Stone customers.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201c33\u201d in the profile name represents the fact that each stone is three inches high and comes in three different lengths\u2013 24&#8243;, 18&#8243; and 12&#8243; creating a random and natural running bond. It will be available nationwide following the show in three natural colors\u2013 Sage, a dark gray with green undertones; Birch, grayish white with brown and orange highlights similar to a birch tree; and Dune, a sand-colored stone with brownish undertones.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe created LedgeCut33 because it offers our customers another design tool for creating more contemporary, lineal stone looks that are both highly textural and natural in appearance,\u201d says Brent Spann, VP of Marketing for Eldorado Stone. \u201cThe smaller pieces are easier to handle and cut from an installer\u2019s perspective, making the stone even more appealing. The three color palettes also provide a broad spectrum of design options,\u201d he says. \u201cThe three different lengths for the stone create additional visual interest, so the profile has incredible versatility because it works in both large and small scale as well as in interior and exterior settings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>LedgeCut33 is available in flats and 90 degree corner pieces allowing you to create authentic stone walls with the appearance of full depth stones.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re very eager to see the response from the design world about LedgeCut33,\u201d says Spann. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to know that we are helping to create new stone profiles that are rich with texture, authenticity and modern design.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT ELDORADO STONE<br \/>\nEldorado Stone, LLC is headquartered in San Marcos, CA.
