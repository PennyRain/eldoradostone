Both colors are available in the acclaimed European Ledge profile, a fusion between old-world stonework and modern design.<br \/>\n\u2022 Barley: Warm, natural tones with white-highlights signify new vibrancy for the popular Cliffstone profile, perfect for transitional and contemporary designs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith these four new hues, we round out our color palette with tones that are both current and timeless,\u201d says Eldorado Stone Vice President of Marketing Brent Spann. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to add these new options, and look forward to seeing how architects, designers and homeowners will transform spaces and incorporate them into their design projects.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The historical timeline of architectural stone begins with the first structures made by man and evolves to the modern structures found in cities around the world today.
