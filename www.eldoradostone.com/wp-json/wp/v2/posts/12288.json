The LEED Platinum-certified project is a complete rebuild of a private residence that was destroyed in 2012 by Hurricane Sandy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHomeowners and designers select our stone veneer because our product and manufacturing process enables them to elevate the beauty and value of their homes while also being environmentally conscious,\u201d said Ramsay Hawfield, Vice President of Marketing and Product Development at Eldorado Stone. \u201cWe were attracted to the Sunset Green Home project for several reasons, but primarily because of the owner\u2019s commitment to utilizing sustainable products and materials.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/ctt.ec\/f43yL\"><strong>TWEET THIS: <\/strong>Sustainable #StoneVeneer from @EldoradoStone featured in @SunsetGreenHome, a #LEED certified Hurricane Sandy rebuild. http:\/\/ctt.ec\/f43yL<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The homeowner, Kim Erle, is a well-known sustainability expert and blogger whose work and guidance has been used by industry giants such as Bob Vila. Erle selected several Eldorado Stone products, including the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eldoradostone.com\/products\/stone\/nationwide-profiles\/stacked-stone\/#\/nantucket\">Nantucket Stacked Stone<\/a> veneer and the all-new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eldoradooutdoor.com\/shop\/categories\/firebowls\/mezzaluna\/\">Mezzaluna Artisan Fire Bowl<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith its CSA approved components and lightweight construction, Eldorado Stone\u2019s Mezzaluna Artisan Fire Bowl was a natural choice for the Sunset Green Home\u2019s elevated deck,\u201d said Erle. \u201cFor finishing the retaining wall and chimney, we had a variety of choices such as stucco, natural stone and architectural stone veneer. We selected Eldorado Stone\u2019s Nantucket Stacked Stone veneer for its sustainable properties, attractive natural stone look and ease of installation. \u201d<\/p>\n<p>Eldorado Stone is able to create sustainable options for homeowners because its stone veneer is manufactured regionally and incorporates pre-consumer recycled content which cuts down on waste. Additionally, at half the weight of natural stone, architectural stone veneer reduces installation time and transportation costs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p># # #<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Eldorado Stone<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Eldorado Stone, LLC is headquartered in San Marcos, Calif.
